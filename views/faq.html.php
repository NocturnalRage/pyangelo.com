        <h3>What languages should I learn?</h3>
        <p>There are so many different programming languages these days, and it's difficult to know which one you should learn. Rest assured that the most important thing is to learn the core concepts of coding and this will have the biggest impact on your learning rather than the specific language. Having said that, Python is an excellent choice as it is used widely in industry and by Universities.</p>

        <h3>Can you offer me private lessons on skype or hangouts?</h3>
        <p>Unfortunately, we don’t have the time or spare capacity to deliver one-on-one lessons. The content in the <a href="/tutorials">tutorials section</a> should answer many questions you have about coding. If not, please don’t hesitate to <a href="/ask-the-teacher">ask us a question</a>. We may end up creating a tutorial based on your problem!</p>
