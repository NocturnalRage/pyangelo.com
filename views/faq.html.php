        <h3>Where do I start?</h3>
        <p>If you don’t know how to code at all, check out our <a href="https://pyangelo.com/tutorials/introduction-to-graphical-programming">Introduction to Graphical Programming tutorial.</a></p>
        <p>If you’re looking for more advanced coding content, take a look at the <a href="/tutorials">tutorial videos</a> page and learn from some of our more intermediate or advanced modules! The modules are arranged in chronological order to guide your progression most effectively.</p>

        <h3>How do I get better at coding?</h3>
        <p>I recommend you watch our <a href="/tutorials">tutorials</a> which correspond to your skill level, and last but not least, write lots of your own programs!</p>

        <h3>What languages should I learn?</h3>
        <p>There are so many different programming languages these days, and it's difficult to know which one you should learn. Rest assured that the most important thing is to learn the core concepts of coding and this will have the biggest impact on your learning rather than the specific language. Having said that, Python is an excellent choice as it is used widely in industry and by Universities.</p>

        <h3>Can you offer me private lessons on skype or hangouts?</h3>
        <p>Unfortunately, we don’t have the time or spare capacity to deliver one-on-one lessons. The content in the <a href="/tutorials">tutorials section</a> should answer many questions you have about coding. If not, please don’t hesitate to <a href="/ask-the-teacher">ask us a question</a>. We may end up creating a tutorial based on your problem!</p>
