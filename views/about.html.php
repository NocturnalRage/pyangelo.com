    <h1>About PyAngelo</h1>
      <p>
      Our mission with PyAngelo is to develop the best coding tutorials
      on the internet. Contrary to popular belief, anyone is able to learn
      how to code with a bit of time, patience, and effort.
      Coding is incredibly fun and rewarding, and we find that the most
      enjoyable part of coding is learning new skills and understanding 
      how to control the computer through instrutions.
      </p>
      <p>
      There are plenty of free tutorials scattered around the internet,
      many of them are quite good. However, we donâ€™t think there is a succinct
      central resource which guides you through the most important coding
      concepts in a fun graphical way. Our aim with PyAngelo is to streamline
      the learning process, teaching you the critical programming skills
      that you can apply to any programming language in the future. 
      </p>
      <p>
      PyAngelo uses the Python programming language but has builtin
      graphical support which makes learning to program so much more
      enjoyable. PyAngelo is built by teachers so we believe that our
      experience and knowledge can help create not only an extremely
      efficient learning process for beginners, but awesome content and
      tutorials for experienced coders as well.
      </p>
      <p>
      Happy coding!
