            <h4>What is your refund policy?</h4>
            <p>
              We have a refund policy to give you peace of mind before
              signing up for a premium subscription. If for any reason
              you aren't happy with your premium membership, simply email
              us within the first TWO weeks of your membership,
              and we can cancel your membership and refund your payment!

            <h4>What payment methods do you accept?</h4>
            <p>
              PyAngelo uses Stripe to process all payments, which can accept
              almost any sort of debit or credit card - including VISA,
              Mastercard, and American Express.

            <h4>Is my credit card information safe?</h4>
            <p>
              Yes. PyAngelo does not store your credit card information - we
              use Stripe to process all our payments. Stripe encrypts all card
              details, and you can read more about their platform security
              <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/security/stripe">here</a>.

            <h4>Is my membership ongoing?</h4>
            <p>
              PyAngelo is a subscription platform, which means you will be
              charged each month for your membership. The PyAngelo monthly
              membership will automatically renew each period,
              so you will be charged unless you cancel your membership.

            <h4>How do I cancel my membership?</h4>
            <p>
            It’s really easy to cancel your membership. Simply go to the
            <a href="/subscription">subscription</a> section on your profile
            page, and click cancel membership. If you have any issues
            cancelling your subscription, <a href="/contact">email us</a>
            and we’ll sort it out for you.

            <h4>If I cancel, will I still have access for the period I paid for?</h4>
            <p>
            Yes, you will! If you cancel a monthly membership, you will still
            have full access until the date at which you were scheduled to
            make your next payment.
